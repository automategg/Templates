# Update-Console
    Console output with settings to change the font color and add a timestamp.

    Output with a font color is great at presenting status or unexpected values. 
    Using Gray for requests, info or benign status, using white for system 
    status or higher status, using green for success or completed, 
    using yellow and red for try, catch blocks, or using blue for highlightable 
    actions.

    Output with a timestamp works very well for console monitoring actions being 
    performed by the script. Timestamping works even better when using 
    transcripts or other logging functionality to troubleshoot issues or to 
    audit tasks.
