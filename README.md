# Templates
Templates and examples for simple functions and scripts. These functions and 
modules are building blocks to piece together more complex code and scripts. I 
like using them as modules to simplify their use in everday scripting and to
simplify more complex scripts. Sometimes, the modules are pasted as functions 
for complex scripts for portability or readability.

# Update-Console
Console output with settings to change the font color and add a timestamp.

Output with a font color is great at presenting status or unexpected values. 
Using Gray for requests, info or benign status, using white for system status or 
higher status, using green for success or completed, using yellow and red for 
try, catch blocks, or using blue for highlightable actions.

Output with a timestamp works very well for console monitoring actions being 
performed by the script. Timestamping works even better when using transcripts 
or other logging functionality to troubleshoot issues or to audit tasks.
